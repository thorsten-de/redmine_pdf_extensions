RedminePdfExtensions is a plugin that extends remines internal pdf generation with following features:

== Render images that are attachmens on other objects

By default, redmine only renders images into the pdf that are attachments of the same object (issue or wiki page).
This plugin enables us to use the url of any attachment (e.g. /attachments/807/download/my-image.jpg) in your object
descrption, both to show that image in the regular html views and to render it into the generated pdf.
